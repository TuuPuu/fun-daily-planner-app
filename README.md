#Fun Daily Planner Application

##Description
This is a fun and functional daily planner app that allows users to manage their time using built in API data designed to streamline your workday organisation.

Key Features:
Current Day Display -> The app prominently displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

Time Blocks for Business Hours -> As users scroll down, the app presents time blocks for standard business hours, making it easy to plan the workday effectively.

Color-Coded Time Blocks -> Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future when viewed. This visual cue helps users quickly identify their current tasks.

Event Entry -> Users can easily enter events by clicking on the desired time block. This ensures a seamless and interactive experience.

Save to Local Storage -> The app allows users to save entered events by clicking the "Save Event" button within each time block. This information is stored in local storage,(however, this feature needs to be built upon).



##Installation
